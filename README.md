# Machine Learning Zoomcamp Study Project

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Zoomcamp** self-study project, inspired by the [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/) curriculum. This repository documents my journey through various machine learning concepts, techniques, and hands-on projects aimed at building a strong foundation in machine learning.

## Introduction

Machine learning is a transformative technology that powers many of the applications we use daily. This study project aims to:

- **Understand** fundamental machine learning concepts and algorithms.
- **Apply** these concepts through hands-on projects and exercises.
- **Build** a portfolio of machine learning projects to showcase my skills.

The curriculum follows the [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://datatalks.club/courses/machine-learning-zoomcamp/) by DataTalks.Club, which provides comprehensive coverage of essential machine learning topics.
