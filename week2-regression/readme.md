# Week 2 - Regression

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and understanding linear regression for predicting car prices. The project includes data preparation, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, validation, and regularization.

## Contents

- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow from data preparation to model evaluation for lecture.
- `homework.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow from data preparation to model evaluation for homework.
- `data.csv`: The dataset used for training and evaluating the regression model.

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
    ```

3. **Follow the steps in the notebook** to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Summary

- **EDA**: Analyzed the data and handled missing values.
- **Target Variable**: Transformed the target variable to handle long tails.
- **Validation Framework**: Split the data into train/val/test sets.
- **Linear Regression**: Implemented and trained a linear regression model.
- **Feature Engineering**: Added new features and handled categorical variables.
- **Regularization**: Applied regularization to improve model stability.
- **Evaluation**: Used RMSE to validate the model.
