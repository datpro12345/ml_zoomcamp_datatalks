## Week 1: Introduction

### Overview
This folder contains the materials and assignments for Week 1 of the course. The focus of this week is to introduce the basic concepts and tools that will be used throughout the course.

### What You'll Learn
In the first week, you'll be introduced to key concepts that form the backbone of machine learning. You will understand what machine learning is, explore its various applications, and learn about the two main types of learning methods: supervised and unsupervised. Here's a detailed breakdown of the topics:

- **What is Machine Learning?**  
  Understand the basic definition and the potential of machine learning in different fields.

- **Applications of Machine Learning**  
  Explore real-world use cases of machine learning across industries like healthcare, finance, and e-commerce.

- **Supervised Learning**  
  Learn about supervised learning, where models are trained using labeled data to make predictions.

- **Unsupervised Learning**  
  Discover how unsupervised learning works by finding patterns and groupings in data without predefined labels.

- **Linear Regression Model**  
  Get introduced to linear regression, one of the simplest and most widely used machine learning algorithms.

- **Cost Function and Gradient Descent**  
  Understand the concepts of cost function and how gradient descent is used to minimize errors in predictions.
